# Autism Spectrum

Autism is a neurological disorder that affects a personâ€™s ability to interact with others, make eye contact with others, learn capacity, and other behavioral and social capabilities of a person.

But there is no ascertain way to tell whether a person has Autism or not because there are no such diagnostics methods available to diagnose this disorder. But what if we use machine learning to predict whether a person suffers from Autism or not?
